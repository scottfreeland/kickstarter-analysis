## Project Overview 
Using Excel, I helped a hopeful playwright prepare how to create goals for a kickstarter campaign that can be used to fund her prospective production. By looking at data from over 4000 completed kickstarters with their outcomes (successful, live, failed, canceled) documented, as well as goals in terms of how much money they'd like to collect, how many campaign-backers they had, and information on the sort of campaigns that were being launched, I was able to inform our playwright of what kind of goals she should set in order to find success in fully funding her play.
## Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Here's a look at the success various kickstarters achieved based on the beginning of when they began their campaigns.

## Parent Category Outcomes
And here is a look at the success various kickstarters achieved based on the parent category for which the campaign fell into.

## Outcomes vs Goals
This is a visual depicting the success that various "play" kickstarters found throughout the duration of time in which this data was collected, based on the "Goal" amount of money they aimed to bring in throughout their kickstarter campaigns. It displays the various ranges of "Goal" money the kickstarters would aim for, and shows the success that each range of "Goal" parameters experienced relative to plays that were either canceled or failed.
