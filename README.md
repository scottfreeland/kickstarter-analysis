## Project Overview 
Using Excel, I helped a hopeful playwright prepare how to create goals for a kickstarter campaign that can be used to fund her prospective production. By looking at data from over 4000 completed kickstarters with their outcomes (successful, live, failed, canceled) documented, as well as goals in terms of how much money they'd like to collect, how many campaign-backers they had, and information on the sort of campaigns that were being launched, I was able to inform our playwright of what kind of goals she should set in order to find success in fully funding her play.
## Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Here's a look at the success various kickstarters achieved based on the beginning of when they began their campaigns.

## Parent Category Outcomes
And here is a look at the success various kickstarters achieved based on the parent category for which the campaign fell into.

## Outcomes vs Goals
This is a visual depiction of the ratio of various outcomes for kickstarters based on the "Goals" that each kickstarter set before launching their respective campaigns.  Various "play" kickstarters set goals to bring in a certain amount of money by the end of their campaigns. The horizontal axis is constituted of various ranges of these "Goal" amounts. The vertical axis displays what proportion that successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters comprised relative to one another, based on the range of where their goals fell, set when they launched.
